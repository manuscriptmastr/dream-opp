# DreamOpp

*"I can't believe it. They told me they weren't hiring until September!"*

**How many times have you missed your dream job by a matter of days?** We don't want to be stuck in the clouds, so we also apply for roles on Indeed we're not interested in with companies we don't care about. Two months later, our dream job shows up and we forgot to follow up with the businesses we really care about.

**Make your dream job become reality** by subscribing to your dream companies â€” you know, those companies who like to post internally, and that you're too ~terrified~ considerate to follow up with regularly.

- **Never miss new openings** at your dream company with mobile notifications
- **Set up reminders** to follow up on dream leads and cultivate relationships
- **Filter out the noise** by describing your ideal roles.
